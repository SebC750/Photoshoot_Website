# Runway Model Photoshoot Website

## Overview
This website will serve as a photoshoot gallery containing high quality photos of a runway model. This site will serve as their official site for all of their work as a model and correspondences will be sent through to her. Her talent as a runway model has yet to be recognized publicly and having a website deployed to the internet would not only bring to light her passion and hard work, but also make it fruitful through potential networking with model agents and scouts who seek incredible talent such as hers. The website will include features such as:

- Gallery of pictures
- Contact page for requests to work with this model.

Both of these things will be their own components and React.js's module system will make modularizing code for both functionalites easy and quick to write. 

This website represents my first time getting into TypeScript and will showcase how I leverage typescript's static typing and OOP components to create more robust and scalable code. Runtime errors are frustrating to deal with during development which dynamic languages like JS do not help in preventing beforehand so Typescript will be more useful for relieving stress over stuff like this. Additionally, all images must have a standard structure to them so interfaces will help with providing a schematic that gives specific properties and data types to those properties. 

This site will be deployed using AWS's S3 for static hosting.

## Future Enhancements
In the future, I plan to add:
- A CMS to allow the model to upload and manage new images easily.
- Additional features like photo filtering by categories and a lightbox for full-size viewing.
- Enhanced SEO features to increase visibility on search engines.
